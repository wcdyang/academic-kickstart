The particles are separated by size into two populations exhibiting size-correlated composition variations. This observation highlights the challenges in synthesizing quaternary CZTS nanoparticles with interparticle composition uniformity. Films of particles from each population are sintered in a selenium atmosphere and found to exhibit a notable degree of phase segregation in the ﬁnal ﬁlm, while a mixture of particles from both populations converts into a relatively homogeneous ﬁlm upon selenization. Devices fabricated from the two particle populations separately as well as the mixture of particles exhibit varying degrees of performance, with the mixed particle cells achieving total area efﬁciencies as high as 7.9\%. A modiﬁed synthesis recipe producing CZTS particles with narrower composition variations is shown to produce devices with improved efﬁciencies up to 8.4\%.

CZTS nanoparticles were prepared following three distinct synthesis protocols described in the literature. Strong ﬂuctuations in composition were observed for Cu and Zn in individual nanoparticles, independent of the synthesis method. Certain particles have regions that have compositions close to that of Cu2SnS3, as well as, in the extreme case, the presence of nearly pure ZnS species. This is an observation that has not been reported in prior studies of these systems and underscores the need to both more carefully study the polydispersity of multinary semiconductor nanoparticles (MSNs) and to improve synthetic protocols and characterization of MSNs. Notablydespite the observation of compositional ﬂuctuations in individual nanoparticlesreactive sintering in Se vapor was shown to reduce the nanoscale compositional ﬂuctuations in the resulting sintered grains, facilitating the use of these heterogeneous particles in optoelectronic devices.},

The resulting dense and selenized Cu2ZnSn(S,Se)4 (CZTSSe) ﬁlms were found to have the same bilayer kesterite structure as absorber layers derived directly from kesterite Cu2ZnSnS4 (CZTS) nanoparticles (Guo, Q.; Ford, G. M.; Yang, W.-C.; Walker, B. C.; Stach, E. A.; Hillhouse, H. W.; Agrawal, R. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2010, 132, 17384−17386). The top layer was fully sintered into micrometer size grains, while the bottom unsintered layer consisted of small, nanometer size kesterite grains. When compared to ﬁlms formed from kesterite CZTS nanoparticles, solar cells fabricated from the wurtzite-derived CZTS nanoparticles were found to have lower power conversion eﬃciencies (PCE). Surprisingly, for those CZTSSe ﬁlms that were formed from wurtzite-derived nanoparticles, it was found that extensive selenization leads to the disappearance of the bottom unsintered layer and the formation of a thin ﬁlm composed of only micrometer-sized grains. These results have signiﬁcant importance for the improvement of the performance of CZTSSe solar materials. Solar cells fabricated from kesterite nanoparticles have delivered a PCE of 9\%despite the presence of an unsintered layer. These results indicate that the use of wurtzite-derived CZTS nanoparticles has the potential to remove the unsintered layer in kesterite CZTSSe solar cells (Miskin, C. K.; Yang, W.-C.; Hages, C.

The progression of the phase transformation into the other half of the bicrystalline Fe2O3 across the bicrystalline boundary led to the formation of a single-crystal phase of γ-Fe2O3 with concomitant oxygen-vacancy ordering on every third \{422\} plane, followed by transformation into Fe3O4. Further reduction resulted in the coexistence of Fe3O4, FeO, and Fe via the transformation pathway Fe3O4 → FeO → Fe. The series of phase transformations was accompanied by the formation of a Swiss-cheese-like structure, induced by the signiﬁcant volume shrinkage occurring upon reduction. These results elucidated the atomistic mechanism of the reduction of Fe oxides and demonstrated formation of hybrid structures of Fe oxides via tuning the phase transformation pathway.},

            Real-time energy dispersive X-ray diffraction (EDXRD) analysis has been utilized to observe the selenization of Cu–Zn–Sn–S nanoparticle films coated from three nanoparticle populations: Cu- and Sn-rich particles roughly 5 nm in size, Zn-rich nanoparticles ranging from 10 to 20 nm in diameter, and a mixture of both types of nanoparticles (roughly 1 : 1 by mass), which corresponds to a synthesis recipe yielding CZTSSe solar cells with reported total-area efficiencies as high as 7.9\%. The EDXRD studies presented herein show that the formation of copper selenide intermediates during the selenization of mixed-particle films can be primarily attributed to the small, Cu- and Sn-rich particles. Moreover, the formation of these copper selenide phases represents the first stage of the CZTSSe grain growth mechanism. The large, Zn-rich particles subsequently contribute their composition to form micrometer-sized CZTSSe grains. These findings enable further development of a previously proposed selenization pathway to account for the roles of interparticle heterogeneities, which in turn provides a valuable guide for future optimization of processes to synthesize high quality CZTSSe absorber layers.},

The synthesis of kesterite Cu2ZnSnS4 nanoparticles by a modiﬁed method of hot injection is explained. Characterization of the nanoparticles by energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy, X-ray diffraction, Raman, and transmission electron microscopy is presented and discussed. When suspended in an ink, coated, and processed into a device, the nanoparticles obtained by this synthesis achieve a total area (active area) efﬁciency of 9.0\% (9.8\%) using AM 1.5 illumination and light soaking. This improvement over the previous efﬁciency of 7.2\% is attributed to the modiﬁed synthesis approach, as well as ﬁne-tuned conditions for selenizing the coated nanoparticles into a dense absorber layer.

	abstract = {Cerium dioxide nanocubes and truncated octahedra were reduced and oxidized in the scanning transmission electron microscope. The reduction process was stimulated by the electron beam and oxidation was supported by background gases in the microscope environment. High-angle annular dark ﬁeld imaging is sensitive to local lattice distortions that arise as oxygen vacancies are created and cerium cations reduce enabling high spatial resolution characterization of this process with temporal resolution on the order of seconds. Such measurements enable us to diﬀerentiate and infer that the observed behavior between the nanocubes and truncated octahedra may be due to the diﬀerence in crystallographic termination of surfaces. In situ measurements taken with different partial pressures of oxygen reveal the cerium oxidation state and the dose rate threshold for the onset of beam reduction are inﬂuenced by the environment. Increasing oxygen partial pressure reduces the Ce3+ content and decreases susceptibility to electron beam driven reduction.},

	abstract = {Solar cells made of polycrystalline thin-ﬁlms can outperform their single-crystalline counterparts despite the presence of grain boundaries (GBs). To unveil the inﬂuence of GBs, high spatial resolution characterization techniques are needed to measure local properties in their vicinity. However, results obtained using single technique may provide limited aspects about the GB eﬀect. Here, we employ two techniques, near-ﬁeld scanning photocurrent microscopy (NSPM) and scanning transmission electron microscope based cathodoluminescence spectroscopy (STEM-CL), to characterize CdTe solar cells at the nanoscale. The signal contrast from the grain interiors (GIs) to the GBs, for high-eﬃciency cells where CdTe is deposited at a high substrate temperature (500 °C) and treated by CdCl2, is found reverse from one technique to another. NSPM reveals increased photocurrents at the GBs, while STEM-CL shows reduced CL intensity and energy redshifts of the spectral peak at the GBs. The results are attributed to the increased nonradiative recombination and the band bending mediated by the surface defects and the shallow-level defects at GBs, respectively. We discuss the advantages of sample geometry for room-temperature STEM-CL and present numerical simulations as well as analytical models to extract the ratio of GB recombination velocity to minority carrier diﬀusivity that can be used for evaluating the GB eﬀect in other polycrystalline solar cells.},

	abstract = {Abstract Synthesis of low-dimensional carbon nanomaterials such as carbon nanotubes (CNTs) is a key driver for achieving advances in energy storage, computing, and multifunctional composites, among other applications. Here, we report high-yield thermal chemical vapor deposition (CVD) synthesis of CNTs catalyzed by reagent-grade common sodium-containing compounds, including NaCl, NaHCO3, Na2CO3, and NaOH, found in table salt, baking soda, and detergents, respectively. Coupled with an oxidative dehydrogenation reaction to crack acetylene at reduced temperatures, Na-based nanoparticles have been observed to catalyze CNT growth at temperatures below 400 °C. Ex situ and in situ transmission electron microscopy (TEM) reveal unique CNT morphologies and growth characteristics, including a vaporizing Na catalyst phenomenon that we leverage to create CNTs without residual catalyst particles for applications that require metal-free CNTs. Na is shown to synthesize CNTs on numerous substrates, and as the first alkali group metal catalyst demonstrated for CNT growth, holds great promise for expanding the understanding of nanocarbon synthesis.},
