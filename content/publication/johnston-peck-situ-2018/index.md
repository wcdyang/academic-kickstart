abstract: "Cerium dioxide nanocubes and truncated octahedra were reduced and oxidized in the scanning transmission electron microscope. The reduction process was stimulated by the electron beam and oxidation was supported by background gases in the microscope environment. High-angle annular dark ﬁeld imaging is sensitive to local lattice distortions that arise as oxygen vacancies are created and cerium cations reduce enabling high spatial resolution characterization of this process with temporal resolution on the order of seconds. Such measurements enable us to diﬀerentiate and infer that the observed behavior between the nanocubes and truncated octahedra may be due to the diﬀerence in crystallographic termination of surfaces. In situ measurements taken with different partial pressures of oxygen reveal the cerium oxidation state and the dose rate threshold for the onset of beam reduction are inﬂuenced by the environment. Increasing oxygen partial pressure reduces the Ce3+ content and decreases susceptibility to electron beam driven reduction."
