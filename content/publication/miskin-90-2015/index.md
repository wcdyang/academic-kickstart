abstract: "Thin-ﬁlm solar cells using Cu2ZnSn(S,Se)4 absorber materials continue to attract increasing attention. The synthesis of kesterite Cu2ZnSnS4 nanoparticles by a modiﬁed method of hot injection is explained. Characterization of the nanoparticles by energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy, X-ray diffraction, Raman, and transmission electron microscopy is presented and discussed. When suspended in an ink, coated, and processed into a device, the nanoparticles obtained by this synthesis achieve a total area (active area) efﬁciency of 9.0% (9.8%) using AM 1.5 illumination and light soaking. This improvement over the previous efﬁciency of 7.2% is attributed to the modiﬁed synthesis approach, as well as ﬁne-tuned conditions for selenizing the coated nanoparticles into a dense absorber layer.
