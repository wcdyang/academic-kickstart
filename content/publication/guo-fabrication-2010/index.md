abstract: "Earth abundant copper-zinc-tin-chalcogenide (CZTSSe) is an important class of material for the development of low cost and sustainable thin ﬁlm solar cells. The fabrication of CZTSSe solar cells by selenization of CZTS nanocrystals is presented. By tuning the composition of the CZTS nanocrystals and developing a robust ﬁlm coating method, a total area efﬁciency as high as 7.2% under AM 1.5 illumination and light soaking has been achieved."
