abstract: "This paper presents a new approach to synthesizing self-aligned, uniform single-crystal cupric oxide (CuO) nanowires on a Cu-based multilayer on SiO2/Si. The key is to introduce CoWP as a nanoﬁlter to catalyze CuO-nanowire synthesis simply by calcination at 400 °C in air. The CuO nanowires (diameter: 10–50 nm, length: 7 lm) exhibit low resistivity (10–60 X cm), a low turn-on ﬁeld (4.5 V lmÀ1) and a high ﬁeld-enhancement factor ($1400)."
