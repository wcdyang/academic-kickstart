David is a Materials Research Engineer within the Physical Measurement Laboratory at the National Institution of Standards and Technology (NIST). His background in Materials Science & Engineering includes a bachelor’s and a master’s degree at the National Tsing Hua University, Taiwan, a Ph.D. at Purdue University, West Lafayette, and postdoctoral training at NIST.

His past research experience, current and proposed work are rooted in understanding light-matter interactions in solid-state materials. For the graduate research, he investigated colloid synthesis of copper-zinc-tin chalcogenide (CZTSSe) nanoparticles to improve CZTSSe thin-films obtained by sintering the nanoparticles. The resultant solar cells showed a world-record power conversion efficiency at the time for CZTSSe made of colloid precursors. His current research interest at NIST is focused on elucidating catalytic mechanisms at the gas-solid interface of plasmonic nanostructures under reactive conditions using environmental scanning transmission electron microscopy (ESTEM) and correlative spectroscopy, including cathodoluminescence and Raman Spectroscopy.
